# Verification Mini-Lab

A small Python project demonstrating verification-style testing on simple signals.
The project generates signals, runs basic checks, and outputs a clear verification report.

## Features
- Signal generation (sine, square, noise)
- Basic verification checks (clipping detection, RMS level)
- Simple and readable verification report
- Clean and modular Python structure

## Why this project
This mini-lab demonstrates a verification-oriented mindset:
structured testing, debugging, and analysis of signal behavior,
similar to practices used in hardware and signal verification environments.

## How to run
```bash
python run_demo.py
